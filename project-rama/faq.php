                            In the event of accidents resulting in damage to the vehicle during the rental period, the user shall be required to pay the non-operation charge (NOC) as partial compensation for the loss of earnings incurred for repairs, regardless of the degree of damage or the length of time required for repairs.
                            <br>
                            The non-operation charge (NOC) is different from the deductible (paid by the user) in the insurance and compensation system, which is applied in the event of accidents. Please note that this sum is to be paid even if you are subscribed to the Safety Package.

                        <p>
                        Each person who intends to drive must bring a valid driver's license to drive in Finland, passport, and a valid means of payment (generally via credit card). All of these items must be submitted on the day the car will be picked up. Kindly pay with an affiliated credit card. If you wish to pay in cash, you must also submit an item of identification (copies are acceptable) in addition to your driver's license.

                            however, each person who intends to drive the car must submit a valid driver’s license on the day the car will be picked up. If it is not possible for all drivers to be present on the day of pick-up, a copy of their driver’s license (both sides) and passport must be prepared in advance and submitted.

                        <p>
                            Yes. No restrictions are placed on the date of issuance of the driver’s license. We have a large-scale compensation system that beginner drivers can use to rent a vehicle without worries. People with little confidence in their driving skills are also welcome to use our services. <br><br>
